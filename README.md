## Project Summary

This project demonstrates a collaborative DevOps workflow between two students using GitHub. Student A initialized the repository and committed the initial automation and configuration files. Student B pulled the repository, updated the web server content, and deployed the application successfully. Student A then pulled the latest changes, verified the deployment, and finalized the project. The web server is running correctly and serving the updated content.  
**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/OmarAskar/devops-automated-webserver.git  

**Lessons Learned:** This project highlighted the importance of proper Git collaboration, clear commit practices, and verifying changes after pulling and also working on VMs and creation of the ansible and docker file that contains webserver image.
